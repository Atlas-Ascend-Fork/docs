# IndexFill

```c

                           DT_DOUBLE}))

```

## Brief

Fills the elements of the input tensor x with value val by selecting the indices in the order given in index.
This is a non in-place replacement operator and does not affect the input tensor of the element.

## Inputs

Three inputs, including:
- x: A tensor that serves as the source; its duplicate is created and subsequently filled with the specified values.
In Atlas A2 products or Atlas A3 products, a tensor of type float16, float32, bfloat16, int64, int32, bool can be
supported.
In Ascend 950PR&950DT products, a tensor of type float16, float32, bfloat16, int64, int32, bool, int8, uint8, int16,
double can be supported.
- indices: A tensor, which equivalent to a vector or scalar. indices of input tensor to fill in. Must be one of the
following types:
    int32, int64.
- val: The value to fill with. It's a scalar or a one-dimensional tensor with only one element.
In Atlas A2 products or Atlas A3 products, a tensor of type float16, float32, bfloat16, int64, int32, bool can be
supported.
In Ascend 950PR&950DT products, a tensor of type float16, float32, bfloat16, int64, int32, bool, int8, uint8, int16,
double can be supported.

## Outputs

y: A tensor with the same shape as 'x'.

## Attributes

dim: A required int. Used to select the dimension of the input tensor.

## Data Types

Note: The preceding prototypes are applicable to all chips, but the Data Types listed below are applicable only to the current chip.
### AI Core
- input0 x: bfloat16,bool,double,float16,float32,int8,int16,int32,int64,uint8
- input1 indices: int32,int64
- output0 y: bfloat16,bool,double,float16,float32,int8,int16,int32,int64,uint8

## Attention Constraints

- The input x and output y must have same shape.
- The data type of element in tensor x must be same with the data type of input val.
- The input indices must be either a 1D tensor (equivalent to vector) or a 0D tensor (equivalent to scalar).

## Third-party framework compatibility

Compatible with the Pytorch operator index_fill.
