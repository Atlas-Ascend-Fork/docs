## Brief

Apply rotary position embedding.

## Inputs

- query: A tensor for transformer query. Must be one of the following types: float16, float32, bfloat16.
- key: A tensor for transformer key. Must be one of the following types: float16, float32, bfloat16.
- cos: A tensor for rotary position embedding cos. Must be one of the following types: float16, float32, bfloat16.
- sin: A tensor for rotary position embedding sin. Must be one of the following types: float16, float32, bfloat16.

## Outputs

- query: A tensor for transformer query. Has the same shape as "query".
- key: A tensor for transformer key. Has the same shape as "key".

## Attributes

- layout: Optional.Explanation input format. 1-"BSND" 2-"SBND" 3-"BNSD". Defaults to 1.
- rotary_mode: Optional.Explanation rotary mode. Support "half","interleave","quarter". Defaults to "half".

## Data Types

Note: The preceding prototypes are applicable to all chips, but the Data Types listed below are applicable only to the current chip.
### AI Core
- input0 query: float16,float32
- input1 key: float16,float32
- input2 cos: float16,float32
- input3 sin: float16,float32
- output0 query: float16,float32
- output1 key: float16,float32

## Attention Constraints

- Inputs  tensor of query, key, cos, sin must be 4D.
- query, key must be the same except for the N dimension, the shape of sin and cos must be the same.
- The B dimension of cos and sin must be consistent with query and key or equal to 1.
- The S dimension of query, key, sin, cos must be the same.
- The N dimension of cos and sin must be equal to 1.
- The D dimension of query, key, sin, cos must be the same and not greater than 1024.
- The dtype of input tensor query, key, sin, cos must be the same.
- When the rotary_mode is "half" or "interleave", the D dimension must be divisible by 2.
when the rotary_mode is "quarter", the D dimension must be divisible by 4
