# ForeachZeroInplace

```c
REG_OP(ForeachZeroInplace)
    .DYNAMIC_INPUT(x, TensorType({DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT16, DT_INT32, DT_INT16, DT_BF16}))
    .OP_END_FACTORY_REG(ForeachZeroInplace)
```

## Brief

Apply zero operation for each tensor in a tensor list in manner of element-wise

## Inputs

One inputs:
- x: A tensor list containing multiple tensors meanwhile, this value is also an output

## Data Types

Note: The preceding prototypes are applicable to all chips, but the Data Types listed below are applicable only to the current chip.
### AI Core
- input0 x: bfloat16,float16,float32,int16,int32
