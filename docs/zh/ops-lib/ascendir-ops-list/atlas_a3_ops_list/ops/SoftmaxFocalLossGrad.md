## Brief

MMCV Function: softmax_focal_loss_grad.

## Inputs

Three inputs, including:
- pred: the predicted tensor. The type support float16 and float32.
- target: the target label Tensor. The type support Int32.
- dout: the grad of previous op grad, which has the sampe shape wth pred. The type support float16 and float32.
- weight: A optional input Tensor, default is None, which helps to calculate the loss by supplying sample weights.
The type support float16 and float32.
    shape of pred should be (B, D), B means batch size, D means the number of labels.
    shape of target should be (B, D).
    shape of weight should be (D, )

## Outputs

grad: A mutable Tensor. Has the same type and shape as "pred".

## Attributes

- alpha: A attribute is used to reweight the sample. The type is float . Default is 0.25
- gamma: A attribute is used to calculate the power of the probability.
    The type is float . Default is 2.0
- reduction: a type of the reduce method. default is 'mean', which means computing the average loss.
'sum' means computing the sum of the loss, 'none' means no reducing. Default is 'mean'

## Data Types

Note: The preceding prototypes are applicable to all chips, but the Data Types listed below are applicable only to the current chip.
### AI Core
- input0 pred: float16,float32
- input1 target: int32
- input2 dout: float16,float32
- input3 weight: float16,float32
- output0 grad: float16,float32

## Third-party framework compatibility

Compatible with the MMCV operator SoftmaxFocalLossGrad.
