# Unsqueeze

```c
REG_OP(Unsqueeze)
    .INPUT(x, TensorType::ALL())
    .OUTPUT(y, TensorType::ALL())
    .ATTR(axes, ListInt, {})
    .OP_END_FACTORY_REG(Unsqueeze)
```

## Brief

x: Original tensor. All data types are supported.

## Outputs

y: Reshape tensor with same data as input. The same type as input x.

## Attributes

axes: List of ints indicating the dimensions to be inserted. Defaults to [].
