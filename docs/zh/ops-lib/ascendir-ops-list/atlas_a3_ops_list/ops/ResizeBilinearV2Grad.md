## Brief

Backwards calculation of ResizeBilinearV2.

## Inputs

- grads: A 4D Tensor, represents the gradient of output of ResizeBilinearV2. Format must be NCHW or NHWC.
Dtype must be float32, float16 or bfloat16.
- original_image: A 4D Tensor, represents the resized image of ResizeBilinearV2. Format must be the same as grads.
When the dtype of grads is float16 or bfloat16, the dtype of original_image must be the same as grads, when the
dtype of grads is float32, the dtype of original_image can be float32, float16 or bfloat16.The N, C dimension
must be the same as grads.

## Outputs

y: A 4D Tensor, represents the gradient of original_image. Format and dtype and shape must be the same as original_image.

## Attributes

- align_corners: An optional bool. If true, the centers of the 4 corner pixels of the input and output tensors are
aligned, preserving the values at the corner pixels. Defaults to false.
- half_pixel_centers: An optional bool. If true, the center of pixels locate in [0.5, 0.5]. Defaults to False.
- scales: An optional listfloat which has two elements. The first element represents the ratio of the H axis
subscripts of pixels in grades to the H axis subscripts of pixels in y, only takes effect when align_corners is
true and the value is greater than 0. The second element represents the ratio of the W axis subscripts of pixels in
grades to the W axis subscripts of pixels in y, only takes effect when align_corners is true and the value is
greater than 0.0f. Defaults to {0.0f, 0.0f}.
