                           DT_INT64, DT_COMPLEX64, DT_COMPLEX128}))

```

## Brief

Returns (x1 - x2)(x1 - x2) element-wise. Support broadcasting operations.

## Inputs

Two inputs, including:
- x1: A ND Tensor. Must be one of the following types: bfloat16, float16, float32,
float64, int32, int64, complex64, complex128.
- x2: A ND Tensor. Has the same dtype as "x1".
The shape of x1 and x2 must meet the requirements of the broadcast relationship.

## Outputs

y: A ND Tensor. Has the same dtype as "x1".

## Data Types

Note: The preceding prototypes are applicable to all chips, but the Data Types listed below are applicable only to the current chip.
### AI Core
- input0 x1: float16,float32,int32
- input1 x2: float16,float32,int32
- output0 y: float16,float32,int32
### AI CPU
- input0 x1: complex64,complex128,double,float16,float32,int32,int64
- input1 x2: complex64,complex128,double,float16,float32,int32,int64
- output0 y: complex64,complex128,double,float16,float32,int32,int64

## Third-party framework compatibility

Compatible with TensorFlow operator SquaredDifference.
