## Brief

Performs batch normalization with support for 4D/5D tensors and training/inference modes.

## Inputs

Five inputs, with format constraints as follows:
- x: A 4D or 5D tensor of type float16, bfloat16, or float32.
       Supported data formats:
       - 4D: NHWC (batch, height, width, channels) or NCHW (batch, channels, height, width).
       - 5D: NDHWC (batch, depth, height, width, channels) or NCDHW (batch, channels, depth, height, width).
- scale: A 1D tensor of type float32, with length equal to the number of channels in "x".
       Specifies the scaling factor (gamma) applied after normalization.
- offset: A 1D tensor of type float32, with length equal to the number of channels in "x".
       Specifies the offset (beta) applied after scaling.
- mean: A 1D tensor of type float32, with length equal to the number of channels in "x".
       - Inference mode (is_training=false): Must be provided as input, representing the
         moving mean computed during training.
       - Training mode (is_training=true): Optional input. When provided, will be used to
         initialize the moving mean for updates; when None, moving mean starts from zeros.
- variance: A 1D tensor of type float32, with length equal to the number of channels in "x".
       - Inference mode (is_training=false): Must be provided as input, representing the
         moving variance computed during training.
       - Training mode (is_training=true): Optional input. When provided, will be used to
         initialize the moving variance for updates; when None, moving variance starts from ones.

## Outputs

Up to six outputs, with shape and format matching "x" unless specified:
- y: A tensor with the same rank (4D/5D), type, and format as "x", containing normalized values.
       (Required output)
- batch_mean: A 1D tensor of type float32 (channel dimension).
       - Training mode: Mean of the current batch (computed over spatial dimensions).
       - Inference mode: Equal to input "mean" (for compatibility).
       (Required output)
- batch_variance: A 1D tensor of type float32 (channel dimension).
       - Training mode: Variance of the current batch (computed over spatial dimensions, with Bessel's correction).
       - Inference mode: Equal to input "variance" (for compatibility).
       (Required output)
- reserve_space_1: Optional 1D tensor of type float32 (channel dimension).
       Reserved for gradient computation.
       - Training mode: Same as batch_mean.
       - Inference mode: Same as input "mean".
- reserve_space_2: Optional 1D tensor of type float32 (channel dimension).
       Reserved for gradient computation.
       - Training mode: saved inv_var (1/sqrt(epsilon + variance), to be reused in the backward gradient computation.
       - Inference mode: Same as input "variance".
- reserve_space_3: A 1D tensor of type float32 with exactly one element.
       Exists solely for TensorFlow compatibility and contains no meaningful data.

## Attributes

- epsilon: Optional float32. Small value added to variance to avoid division by zero.
       Defaults to 0.0001f.
- data_format: Optional string. Specifies the data format of "x".
       Allowed values: "NHWC" (4D default), "NCHW" (4D), "NDHWC" (5D), "NCDHW" (5D).
- is_training: Optional bool. Specifies operation mode:
       - true: Training mode (computes batch mean/variance and updates moving stats).
       - false: Inference mode (uses provided mean/variance for normalization).
       Defaults to true.
- exponential_avg_factor: Optional float32. Factor for updating moving averages during training.
       Formula: new_mean = (1 - factor) * old_mean + factor * batch_mean.
       Defaults to 1.0f.
