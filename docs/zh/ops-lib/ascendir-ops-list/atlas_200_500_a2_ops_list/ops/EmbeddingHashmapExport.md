```

## Brief

Export table data from the embedding table to file.

## Inputs

- file_path: A Scalar, dtype is string, indicates the file path to export.
There are two types of paths: folder path with a file name prefix such as /home/path/ckpt
and folder path without a file name prefix such as /home/path/.
- table_ids: A Tensor, dtype is int32, indicates the hash table id.
- table_names: A Tensor, dtype is string, indicates the hash table names.
- global_step: A Scalar, dtype is DT_INT32/DT_INT64. 0-D. indicates the export save step.
- keys: Tensors which number is consistent with table's number, dtype is int64,
                indicates the original hash key for one table.
- counters: Tensors which number is consistent with table's number, dtype is uint64,
                indicates the counters of each hashmap.
- filter_flags: Tensors which number is consistent with table's number, dtype is uint8,
                indicates the filter flag of each hashmap.
- values: Tensors which number is consistent with table's number, dtype is float32.
               indicates the value of each hashmap.
