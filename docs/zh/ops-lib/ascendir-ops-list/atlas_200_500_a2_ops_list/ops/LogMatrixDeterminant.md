# LogMatrixDeterminant

```c
REG_OP(LogMatrixDeterminant)
    .INPUT(x, TensorType({DT_FLOAT, DT_DOUBLE, DT_COMPLEX64, DT_COMPLEX128}))
    .OUTPUT(sign, TensorType({DT_FLOAT, DT_DOUBLE, DT_COMPLEX64, DT_COMPLEX128}))
    .OUTPUT(y, TensorType({DT_FLOAT, DT_DOUBLE, DT_COMPLEX64, DT_COMPLEX128}))
    .OP_END_FACTORY_REG(LogMatrixDeterminant)
```

## Brief

Computes the sign and the log of the absolute value of the determinant
of one or more square matrices .

## Inputs

The input x is a tensor of shape [N, M, M] whose inner-most 2 dimensions
form square matrices. Inputs include:
x:A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: double, float32,
complex64, complex128. Shape is [..., M, M] .

## Outputs

- y:A Tensor. Has the same type as x.
- sign:A Tensor. Has the same type as x .

## Data Types

Note: The preceding prototypes are applicable to all chips, but the Data Types listed below are applicable only to the current chip.
### AI CPU
- input0 x: complex64,complex128,double,float32
- output0 sign: complex64,complex128,double,float32
- output1 y: complex64,complex128,double,float32

## Attention Constraints

The input x is a tensor of shape [N, M, M] whose inner-most 2 dimensions
form square matrices.

## Third-party framework compatibility

Compatible with tensorflow LogMatrixDeterminant operator.
