## Brief

Perform topk-topp-sample sampling calculations based on input word frequency logits, top-k/top-p sampling
parameters, and random sampling weight distribution q. Output the maximum word frequency logits_select_idx for each
batch, along with the word frequency distribution logits_top_kp_select after topk-topp sampling.

## Inputs

Four inputs, including:
- logits: A Required tensor in [batch, voc_size] on default. Acts as the input word frequencies to be sampled. The
frequency index is fixed as the last dimension. Currently supports 2 dimensions. Supports non-contiguous tensors, and
must be a non-null pointer.
  The supported types are:float16, bfloat16, format supports ND.
- top_k: A Required tensor in [batch, ] on default. Acts as the sampled k-value for each batch. The supported types
are: int32, Supports non-contiguous tensors, and must be a non-null pointer.
- top_p: A Required tensor in [batch, ] on default. Acts as the p-value sampled for each batch. The supported types
are: float16, bfloat16, Supports non-contiguous tensors, and must be a non-null pointer.
- q: An optional tensor in [batch, voc_size], Defaults to "None". A Required tensor in [batch, ] on default. Acts as
the sampled k-value for each batch. The supported types are: float32, Supports non-contiguous tensors.

## Outputs

- logits_select_idx: A 2D tensor which is the sequence of numbers, format supports ND, and must be a non-null
pointer.
   The supported types are: int64.
- logits_top_kp_select: An optional 2D tensor. Acts as the logits remaining in the logits file after undergoing the
topK-topP calculation process. When `is_need_logits=False`, it is disabled and outputs a null pointer; when
`is_need_logits=True`, it is enabled and outputs a dimension that must be [batch, voc_size]. The supported types are:
float32.

## Attributes

- eps: An optional attribute of type float. Prevent division by zero in softmax and weight sampling; default value
1e-8.
- is_need_logits：An optional attribute of type bool. Control the output condition of logits_top_kp_select,
defaulting to False for empty return. When set to True, a Tensor sized of [batch, voc_size] contains only remaining
logits at their origin position in the input logits, will be returned as the logits_top_kp_select.
- top_k_guess: An optional attribute of type int32. Indicates the size of candidate logits for each batch when
attempting top-P partial traversal sampling. Must be a positive integer, defaulting to 32.

## Data Types
