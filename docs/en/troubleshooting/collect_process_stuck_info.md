# Collect Information About Process Suspension

The information can be collected manually or automatically.

- Manual collection: Collect host and device logs and files. Only the minimum set of information is collected.
- Automatic collection: On the host server, use the  [asys](https://gitcode.com/cann/oam-tools/blob/9.2.0/docs/en/asys/asys_functions_and_restrictions.md)  tool to collect all fault-related information, including the installation version information, device health status information, dump files, operator compilation information, and full log files.

    Note: The asys tool can be used to collect fault information in only limited scenarios, excluding cluster, container, virtual machines, and cloud.

## Manual Collection

To collect application logs and trace logs, perform the following steps:

1. Plan a directory for storing log files on the host server, for example,  **$\{HOME\}/err\_log\_info/**.
2. The default path of application log files is  **_$\{HOME\}_/ascend/log**  on the host server. Move the log files to the  **err\_log\_info**  directory.

    ```bash
    mv ${HOME}/ascend/log ${HOME}/err_log_info/
    ```

3. The default path of trace log files is  **$HOME/ascend/atrace/**  on the host server. Move the log files to the  **err\_log\_info**  directory.

    ```bash
    mv $HOME/ascend/atrace ${HOME}/err_log_info/
    ```

For details about log levels, log paths, and log files, see  [Log Reference](https://gitcode.com/cann/runtime/blob/9.2.0/docs/zh/log_ref/README.md).

## Automatic Collection

For details about the restrictions on using the asys tool, see  [Functions and Restrictions of the asys Tool](https://gitcode.com/cann/oam-tools/blob/9.2.0/docs/en/asys/asys_functions_and_restrictions.md). Before using the asys tool, install and configure it. For details, see the prerequisites in  [Environment Setup](https://gitcode.com/cann/oam-tools/blob/9.2.0/docs/en/asys/asys_environment_preparation.md).

The following is an example of the asys tool command. Run the  **asys collect**  command to collect fault information.

```bash
asys collect --output="path"
```

**output**  indicates the directory for saving collected information. For details about the parameters and restrictions, see  [Fault Information Collection](https://gitcode.com/cann/oam-tools/blob/9.2.0/docs/en/asys/fault_information_collection.md).
