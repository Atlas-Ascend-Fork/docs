# DVPP Engine Error

## Symptom

Video decoding fails. The error message "\[dvpp\_ioct1\_vpc 845\] call proc failed:-512, engine\_id:1" is displayed in the device log, as shown in the following:

## Possible Cause

According to the log, it is an error code returned by the VPC engine.  **-512**  indicates that it is caused by the abnormal interrupt when waiting for video decoding. It may occur when the user-mode process exits, resulting in abnormal interrupt when waiting for decoding.

## Solution

View the log file on the host to check the cause of the abnormal exit of the user-mode process.

## Other Error Codes

In addition to the  **-512**  error code returned by the VPC in the samples, other engines of the DVPP driver have their own return codes, as shown in Table 1.

Similarly, you can determine the engine that returns the error code based on the service type and the error code displayed in the device log file. Then, obtain the corresponding error code description based on the error code value to preliminarily determine the fault cause.
