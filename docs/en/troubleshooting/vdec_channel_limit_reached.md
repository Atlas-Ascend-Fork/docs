# Failure in Creating a VDEC Channel Due to the Upper Limit in the Ascend Virtual Instance Scenario

## Symptom

Once the number of channels reaches a certain level, no more VDEC channels can be created.

A log example on the device is as follows:

```text
pid 0 usr chn 0 device 0 chn 0 vf_id 1 has created chn num(27) is full, max chn num = 27
```

>**NOTE:**
>In EP mode, after running the decoding process, log in to the host and run the  **msnpureport -a**  command in the directory on which you have the read, write, and execute permissions to export the log information of the device.
>In RC mode, log in to the board environment and run the  **cat /proc/umap/vdec**  command to export decoding information.

## Possible Cause

Different computing power templates have different upper limits on the total number of channels. If the number of channels exceeds the upper limit, no more channels can be created.

## Solution

1. Query VDEC resource information in the used computing power template.

    **Table  1** **Ascend virtual instance  configuration**  \(Atlas inference products\)

| Name (of Compute Group) | Specification | Number of AI Cores in Compute Resources | Memory (GB) | AI CPU (device_aicpu in Compute Resources) | VPC | JPEGD | JPEGE | VENC | VDEC |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Total resources | 1 | 8 | The value is the same as the value of memory_size obtained by calling dsmi_get_memory_info. | 7 | 12 | 16 | 8 | 3 | 12 |
| vir04 | 1/2 | 4 | memory_size/2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 6 |
| vir04_3c | 1/2 | 4 | memory_size/2 | 3 | 6 | 8 | 4 | 1 | 6 |
| vir04_4c_dvpp | 1/2 | 4 | memory_size/2 | 4 | 12 | 16 | 8 | 3 | 12 |
| vir04_3c_ndvpp | 1/2 | 4 | memory_size/2 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| vir02 | 1/4 | 2 | memory_size/4 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 1 | 3 |
| vir02_1c | 1/4 | 2 | memory_size/4 | 1 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 0 | 3 |
| vir01 | 1/8 | 1 | memory_size/8 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 1 |

2. Calculate the upper limit of the total number of channels based on the VDEC resource information.

    Upper limit of the total number of  _decoding channels = \(JPEGD + VDEC\) / \(16 + 12\) x 256_.

    For example, in the  **vir01**  template, the maximum number of decoding channels is = \(2 + 1\) / \(16 + 12\) x 256 = 27.
