# Single-operator Running Error

## Analysis Result

If the following conclusion is provided in the  **info.txt**  file, an error is reported during the running of a single operator or the pass is abnormal.

```text
**********************Root cause conclusion******************
Failed to execute the single-operator test case. The operator logic may be incorrect.
```

In this case, you can use the single-operator reproduction method to rectify the fault based on the following information in the  **info.txt**  file. You can also run the  **python3 test\_single\_op.py**  command to view the error information reported during the execution of the abnormal operator and analyze the cause of the error.

1. The following is an example of the operator information provided in  **Basic information** . YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM:SS.fff.uuu (year-month-day-hour:minute:second.millisecond.microsecond) represents the log output time.

## Fault Root Causes

The possible causes are as follows:

- The logic of the operator is incorrect. For example, some unallocated addresses are read or written.
- The compiler is incorrect. The logic of the operator is correct, but the compiler compiles the operator into an incorrect bottom-layer assembly instruction. As a result, the chip reports an AI Core error.
- The input data is incorrect. Generally, the input data is used as the index input. Incorrect indexes cause unauthorized access to operators.
- The TilingData data computation or selection is incorrect.

## Solution

This type of problem can be located and handled by reproducing a single operator.

After  **msaicerr.py**  is executed for analysis, the  **info\_\{_timestamp_\}/debug\_info.txt**  file and the abnormal operator test script  **info\_\{_timestamp_\}/aicerror\_\{_number_\}\_\{_timestamp_\}/test\_single\_op.py**  are generated in the same directory where  **msaicerr.py**  is executed.

In the  **debug\_info.txt**  file, run the command \(as shown in the following example\) of the abnormal operator test script, and then execute the script to reproduce the AI Core error.

```text
Run 'export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/Ascend/CANN-7.3/tools/msaicerr/:$PYTHONPATH;cd /usr/local/Ascend/CANN-7.3/tools/msaicerr;python3 /home/xxxxxxx/xxx/info_xxxx/aicerror_xxxx/test_single_op.py' can test op!
```

>**NOTE:**
>You need to collect the analysis result of  **msaicerr.py**  \(all files in the  **info\__timestamp_**  directory\). If the fault cannot be located or rectified based on these files, submit an issue at  [https://gitee.com/ascend](https://gitee.com/ascend)  for help.
