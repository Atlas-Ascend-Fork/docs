# Locating Memory OOM Errors

You can perform the following steps to locate a fault. If the fault persists, obtai the logs, and click [here](https://www.hiascend.com/support) to submit feedback.

In the preparation phase, you need to collect CANN log files. For details about how to collect CANN log files \(including application logs and on-device system logs\), see  [Collecting Memory OOM Error Information](collect_memory_oom_info.md). The following uses  **$\{HOME\}/err\_log\_info/**  as an example of directory for storing collected logs.

The locating process is as follows:

1. Check the native C APIs.

    Check whether a standard C API  **malloc**  or  **memset**  is used to allocate the host memory for the application. If so, use the third-party ASan tool to detect memory errors and optimize the code logic.

2. Check the CANN memory allocation.

    In the host application log file  **_$\{HOME\}_/err\_log\_info/log/\[run|debug\]/plog/plog-_pid_  \_\*.log**, find the log generated around the time when the OOM error occurs and determine the error type based on the error API.

    - If the error information indicates that the  **aclrtMallocHost**  API provided by CANN is used to allocate the host memory, OOM is caused by the host memory error.

        In this case, search for the keyword  **mem\_stats**  in the log file and check the memory allocation statistics of components. For details, see  [Checking Memory Statistics of Each CANN Component](view_cann_memory_stats.md). If the memory occupied by each component does not meet the expectation, click [here](https://www.hiascend.com/support) to submit feedback.

    - If the error information indicates that the  **aclrtMalloc**,  **aclrtMallocPhysical**, and  **hi\_mpi\_dvpp\_malloc**  APIs provided by CANN are used to allocate the device memory, OOM is caused by the device memory error.

        In this case, search for the keyword  **mem\_stats**  in the log file and check the memory allocation statistics of the components or framework. For details, see  [Checking Memory Statistics of Each CANN Component](view_cann_memory_stats.md). If the memory occupied by each component does not meet the expectation, click [here](https://www.hiascend.com/support) to submit feedback.

    - If other error information is displayed, OOM is caused by abnormal device service processes. In this case, search for the keyword  **DEV\_PROC\_MEM**  in the log file and view the memory statistics of each service process. For details, see  [Checking the Memory Statistics of the Device Service Processes](view_device_process_mem_stats.md). If the memory occupied by each service process does not meet the expectation, click [here](https://www.hiascend.com/support) to submit feedback.
