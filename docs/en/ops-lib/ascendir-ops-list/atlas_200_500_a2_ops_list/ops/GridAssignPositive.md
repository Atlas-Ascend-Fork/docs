## Inputs

- assigned_gt_inds: A tensor of type float16 or float32, shape (n, ).
 Indicates the assigned ground truth index for each predicted box.
- overlaps: A tensor. Datatype is same as assigned_gt_inds, IOU(Intersection over Union, between[0,1]) between gt_bboxes and bboxes, shape (k, n).
 Where k is the number of ground truths, n is the number of predicted boxes.
- box_responsible_flags: A tensor. Support uint8, shape (n, ).
 Flag to indicate whether the box is responsible for being assigned to a ground truth.
- max_overlaps: A tensor. Datatype is same as assigned_gt_inds, overlaps.max(axis=0), shape (n, ).
 Maximum IOU for each predicted box across all ground truths.
- argmax_overlaps: A tensor. Support int32, overlaps.argmax(axis=0), shape (n, ).
 Index of the ground truth with maximum IOU for each predicted box.
- gt_max_overlaps: A tensor. Datatype is same as assigned_gt_inds, overlaps.max(axis=1), shape (k, ).
 Maximum IOU for each ground truth across all predicted boxes.
- gt_argmax_overlaps: A tensor. Support int32, overlaps.argmax(axis=1), shape (k, ).
 Index of the predicted box with maximum IOU for each ground truth.
- num_gts: A tensor. Support int32, shape (1, ).
 Real number of ground truths

## Outputs

assigned_gt_inds_pos: A tensor. Support float16/float32, shape (n, ).
  The final assigned ground truth indices for positive bboxes, used for gradient computation.

## Attributes

- pos_iou_thr: float. IOU threshold for positive bboxes. Bboxes with IOU >= pos_iou_thr are considered positive.
- min_pos_iou: float. Minimum IOU for a bbox to be considered as a positive bbox.
- gt_max_assign_all: bool. Whether to assign all bboxes with the same highest overlap with some gt to that gt.
