# HcomReduce

```c
REG_OP(HcomReduce)
    .INPUT(x, TensorType({DT_FLOAT, DT_INT32, DT_INT8, DT_INT16, DT_FLOAT16, DT_INT64}))
    .OUTPUT(y, TensorType({DT_FLOAT, DT_INT32, DT_INT8, DT_INT16, DT_FLOAT16, DT_INT64}))
    .REQUIRED_ATTR(root_rank, Int)
    .REQUIRED_ATTR(reduction, String)
    .REQUIRED_ATTR(group, String)
    .ATTR(fusion, Int, 0)
    .ATTR(fusion_id, Int, -1)
    .OP_END_FACTORY_REG(HcomReduce)
```

## Brief

preforms reduction from others rank to rootrank

## Inputs

- root_rank: A required integer identifying the root rank in the op
the reduction result will be on this root rank
x: A tensor. Must be one of the following types: int8, int16, int32, int64, float16,
float32.

## Outputs

y: A Tensor. Has the same type as "x".

## Attributes

- reduction: A required string identifying the reduction operation to
perform.The supported operation are: "sum", "max", "min", "prod".
- group: A required string identifying the group name of ranks
participating in the op.
- fusion: An optional integer identifying the fusion flag of the op.
0: no fusion; 1 (default): fusion; 2: fusion the ops by fusion id.
- fusion_id: An optional integer identifying the fusion id of the op.
The HcomReduce ops with the same fusion id will be fused.

## Attention Constraints

"group" is limited to 128 characters. Use "hccl_world_group"
as the name of a world group.
