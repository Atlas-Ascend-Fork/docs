# Mish

```c
REG_OP(Mish)
    .INPUT(x, TensorType({ DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT16, DT_BF16 }))
    .OUTPUT(y, TensorType({ DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT16, DT_BF16 }))
    .OP_END_FACTORY_REG(Mish)
```

## Brief

Computes hyperbolic tangent of "x" element-wise .

## Inputs

One input:
x: An ND tensor. support 1D ~ 8D. Must be one of the following types:
float16, float32, bfloat16.

## Outputs

y: A Tensor. Has the same type as "x" .

## Data Types

Note: The preceding prototypes are applicable to all chips, but the Data Types listed below are applicable only to the current chip.
### AI Core
- input0 x: bfloat16,float16,float32
- output0 y: bfloat16,float16,float32

## Third-party framework compatibility

Compatible with TensorFlow operator Mish.
