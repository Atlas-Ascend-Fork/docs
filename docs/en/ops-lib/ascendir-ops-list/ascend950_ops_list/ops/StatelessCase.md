# StatelessCase

```c
REG_OP(StatelessCase)
    .INPUT(branch_index, DT_INT32)
    .DYNAMIC_INPUT(input, TensorType::ALL())
    .DYNAMIC_OUTPUT(output, TensorType::ALL())
    .DYNAMIC_GRAPH(branches)
    .OP_END_FACTORY_REG(StatelessCase)
```

## Brief

Select one of the subgraphs to pass the input tensors and return the output tensors .

## Inputs

- branch_index: A int32 scalar which determines the selected subgraph.
- input: The input tensors, which will be passed to the subgraph . It's a dynamic input.

## Outputs

output: The output tensors returned by one of branches . It's a dynamic output.

## Graphs

branches: A list of subgraphs, each of which takes 'input' and returns a list of tensors,
         whose types are the same as what every other subgraph returns .

## Third-party framework compatibility

Compatible with the TensorFlow operator Case.
