# Lerp

```c
REG_OP(Lerp)
    .INPUT(start, TensorType({DT_FLOAT16, DT_FLOAT, DT_BF16}))
    .INPUT(end, TensorType({DT_FLOAT16, DT_FLOAT, DT_BF16}))
    .INPUT(weight, TensorType({DT_FLOAT16, DT_FLOAT, DT_BF16}))
    .OUTPUT(y, TensorType({DT_FLOAT16, DT_FLOAT, DT_BF16}))
    .OP_END_FACTORY_REG(Lerp)
```

## Brief

Calculate the lerp function.

## Inputs

Three inputs, including:
- start: A ND tensor. Must be one of the following types:
    float16, float32, bfloat16.
The shape of start, end and weight should satisfy the broadcast relationship.
- end: A ND tensor. Must be one of the following types:
    float16, float32, bfloat16.
- weight: A ND tensor. Must be one of the following types:
    float16, float32, bfloat16.

## Outputs

y: A ND tensor with the same dtype of start's.
The shape of 'y' is same as the shape of the tensor
whose shape is generated after 'start', 'end', and 'weight' broadcast opratioan.

## Data Types

Note: The preceding prototypes are applicable to all chips, but the Data Types listed below are applicable only to the current chip.
### AI Core
- input0 start: bfloat16,float16,float32
- input1 end: bfloat16,float16,float32
- input2 weight: bfloat16,float16,float32
- output0 y: bfloat16,float16,float32

## Third-party framework compatibility

Compatible with the PyTorch operator Lerp.
