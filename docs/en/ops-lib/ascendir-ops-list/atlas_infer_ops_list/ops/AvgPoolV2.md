## Brief

Performs average pooling on the input.

## Inputs

x: A tensor of shape [N, C, H, W] or [N, H, W, C] which supports data type float16, float32, double.

## Outputs

y: The average pooled output tensor. Has the same type and format as
input "x".

## Attributes

- ksize: A required ListInt, list of 4 ints, specifying the size (N, C, H, and W)
of the sliding window, where N = C = 1,
and H and W are positive integers within the range [1, 255].
- strides: A required ListInt, list of 4 ints, specifying the stride of the
sliding window. The strides of the N and C dimensions are 1.
The strides of the H and W dimensions are positive integers within
the range [1, 63].
- padding_mode: An optional String, specifying the padding algorithm,
either "VALID", "SAME" and "CALCULATED".
With "SAME" means that the outputs will have the same spatial dimensions
as its inputs. With "VALID" means no padding.
- pads: A optional ListInt. Pad value when padding_mode is "CALCULATED".
- data_format: An optional String, specifying the data format of "ksize"
and "strides", either "NHWC", or "NCHW" (default).
- global_pooling: An optional Bool. Global or not. If true, pads will change to {0,0,0,0}
and ksize will change to [input_h, input_w].
- ceil_mode: An optional Bool. Use ceil or floor to calculate the output size when
padding_mode is "CALCULATED".
- exclusive: An optional Bool. Ignore padding area or not when calculating average.
- divisor_override: An optional Int, its valid range is [1, 255], and the default value is zero.
if specified, it will be used as divisor, otherwise size of the pooling region will be used.

## Data Types

Note: The preceding prototypes are applicable to all chips, but the Data Types listed below are applicable only to the current chip.
### AI Core
- input0 x: float16,int8
- output0 y: float16,int32
### AI CPU
- input0 x: double,float16,float32
- output0 y: double,float16,float32

## Attention Constraints

- Only single input and single output are supported.
- Global pooling is supported.
- "ksize_H" and "ksize_W" are positive integers within the range [1, 255].
ksize_H * ksize_W < 256
- Due to instruction restrictions,
the values of "strides_h" and "strides_w" are positive integers within
the range [1, 63].
- If the sliding window range exceeds the original width and height of the input feature map,
and the calculation result of count_include_pad is False, the behavior of dividing by 0 will appear.
This scenario does not conform to the normal logic of the operator.
It is recommended to modify attributes such as ceil_mode or stride to satisfy that the sliding window
always has an intersection with the input feature map. In this abnormal scenario,
different chips may return different results, and four abnormal results may appear: 0, 65504, Nan, and INF.
- When the C axis is greater than 1, if points with the same H and W dimensions in x contain one INF input
on the C axis, the output of the INF input covered by the sliding window on this C axis is INF, and the
outputs of other C axis without INF input covered by the sliding window are Nan. If points with the same
H and W dimensions in x contain more than one INF input on the C axis, the outputs of all INF input data
covered by the sliding window on the C axis are Nan.

## Third-party framework compatibility

Compatible with the TensorFlow operator AvgPoolV2.
