# FileConstant

```c
REG_OP(FileConstant)
    .OUTPUT(y, TensorType::ALL())
    .ATTR(file_path, String, "")
    .ATTR(file_id, String, "")
    .REQUIRED_ATTR(shape, ListInt)
    .REQUIRED_ATTR(dtype, Type)
    .OP_END_FACTORY_REG(FileConstant)
```

## Brief

Creates a file constant tensor, The operator is used to process the very large weight which is store in file.

## Outputs

y: The FileConstant tensor.

## Attributes

file_path: A string, used to record file path.
file_id: A string, used to record file id.
shape: data shape.
dtype: data type.
