## Brief

Creates batches of tensors in "x_tensors" .

## Inputs

Input "x_tensors" is a list or a dictionary of tensors.
x_tensors: The list or dictionary of tensors to enqueue.
It's a dynamic input. Must be one of the following types:
float16, float32, int8, int16, uint16, uint8, int32, int64, bool, double.

## Outputs

- y_index: A Tensor. The index of a BatchTensor. Must be in row-major order.
- y_id: A Tensor. The ID of a BatchTensor. Must be in row-major order.
- y_tensors: A list or dictionary of tensors with
the same types as "x_tensors" .  It's a dynamic output.

## Attributes

- num_batch_threads: An optional int. The number of threads enqueuing "x_tensors".
The batching will be nondeterministic if "num_batch_threads" > 1.
- max_batch_size: An optional int. The maximum batch size pulled from the queue.
- max_enqueued_batches: An optional int. Defaults to 10. The maximum number of batches pulled from the queue.
- batch_timeout_micros: The batch processing timeout, in microseconds.
- allowed_batch_sizes: An optional int list. The allowed batch size pulled from the queue.
- grad_timeout_micros: The gradient batch processing timeout,
in microseconds.
- container: An optional string. Defaults to "". If non-empty, this queue is placed in the given container.
Otherwise, a default container is used.
- shared_name: An optional string. Defaults to "". If set, this queue will be shared under the given name
across multiple sessions.
- batching_queue: An optional string. Defaults to "". The queue resource container.

## Data Types

Note: The preceding prototypes are applicable to all chips, but the Data Types listed below are applicable only to the current chip.
### AI CPU
- output1 y_index: int64
- output2 y_id: int64

## Attention Constraints

Batch runs on the Ascend AI CPU, which delivers poor performance.

## Third-party framework compatibility

Compatible with the TensorFlow operator Batch.
