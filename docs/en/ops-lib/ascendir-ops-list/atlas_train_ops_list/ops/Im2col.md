## Brief

Performs Im2col for each batch entry.

## Inputs

x: A 4D tensor with shape [batch, in_rows, in_cols, depth] in NHWC format or [batch, depth, in_rows, in_cols] in NCHW
format, must be one of the following types: bfloat16, float16, float32, double, int8, int16, int32, int64, uint8,
uint16, uint32, uint64, complex32, complex64, bool.
The following types are valid only for Ascend950 AI Processors and later products: complex32, complex64, bool.
The inputs must have data_format with one of follows: NHWC, NCHW.

## Outputs

y: A 4D tensor has same dtype as "x", with shape
[batch, out_rows, out_cols, ksize_rows * ksize_cols * depth] in NHWC format or
[batch, ksize_rows * ksize_cols * depth, out_rows, out_cols] in NCHW format.
containing image patches with size ksize_rows x
ksize_cols x depth vectorized in the "depth" dimension.
Note "out_rows" and "out_cols" are the dimensions of the output patches.

## Attributes

- ksizes: A required list or tuple. The size of the sliding window for
each dimension of images, shape:(2), value: (ksizes_h, ksizes_w).
- strides: An optional list or tuple. The distance between the centers of two consecutive patches in the images,
the size of strides only support 1 or 2 which indicates:
size of strides == 1 : strides_h = strides[0]; strides_w = strides[0];
size of strides == 2 : strides_h = strides[0]; strides_w = strides[1];
Defaults to "{1,1}".
- dilations: An optional list or tuple, the size of dilations only support 1 or 2 which indicates:
size of dilations == 1 : dilations_h = dilations[0]; dilations_w = dilations[0];
size of dilations == 2 : dilations_h = dilations[0]; dilations_w = dilations[1];
Defaults to "{1,1}".
This is the input stride, specifying how far two consecutive patch
samples are in the input. Equivalent to extracting patches
with patch_sizes_eff = patch_sizes + (patch_sizes - 1) *
(dilations - 1), followed by subsampling them spatially
by a factor of dilations.
This is equivalent to rate in dilated (a.k.a. Atrous) convolutions.
- padding_mode: An optional String. The type of padding algorithm to use,
support "SAME", "VALID", "CALCULATED". Among the three modes, only the
"CALCULATED" means to use the pads below. Defaults to "CALCULATED".
- pads: An optional list or tuple. The pad distance.
When padding_mode is equal to "CALCULATED", the size of pads only support 1, 2 or 4 which indicates:
size of pads == 1 : pad_h_top = pad[0]; pad_h_bottom = pad[0]; pad_w_before = pad[0]; pad_w_after = pad[0];
size of pads == 2 : pad_h_top = pad[0]; pad_h_bottom = pad[0]; pad_w_before = pad[1]; pad_w_after = pad[1];
size of pads == 4 : pad_h_top = pad[0]; pad_h_bottom = pad[1]; pad_w_before = pad[2]; pad_w_after = pad[3];
pad_h_top and pad_h_bottom should be added to h-dimension of outputshape.
pad_w_before and pad_w_after should be added to w-dimension of outputshape.
Defaults to "{0,0}".

## Data Types

Note: The preceding prototypes are applicable to all chips, but the Data Types listed below are applicable only to the current chip.
### AI Core
- input0 x: float16,int8,uint8
- output0 y: float16,int8,uint8

## Attention Constraints

"ksizes", "strides", "dilations" and "pads" are lists of integers.

## Third-party framework compatibility

Compatible with Pytorch Im2col operator.
