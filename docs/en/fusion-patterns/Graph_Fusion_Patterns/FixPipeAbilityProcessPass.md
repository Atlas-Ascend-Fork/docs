# FixPipeAbilityProcessPass

## Description

Adds the `support_fixpipe_ability` attribute to a Fixpipe node. This attribute has the following enumerated values:

- `1`: The Conv2D and DepthwiseConv2D operators support Fixpipe dual outputs when the number of outputs is 2.
- `2`: Conv2DBackpropFilterD and DepthwiseConv2DBackpropFilterD use atomic write.
- `3`: Fixpipe processing is not supported.

## Constraints

This fusion pattern cannot be disabled.

The validity of this pass depends on whether the running product supports the corresponding operator type. For details, see [Ascend IR Operator Specifications](https://www.hiascend.com/en-sg/document/detail/en/CANNCommunityEdition/latest/API/aolapi/operatorlist_00094.html) in the operator library.
