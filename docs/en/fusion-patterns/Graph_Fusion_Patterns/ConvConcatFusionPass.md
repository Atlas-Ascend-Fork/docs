## Description

Inserts a StridedWrite operator before a Concat operator. The inserted StridedWrite, instead of the Concat operator, will concatenate Conv2D memory to reduce the performance consumption caused by Concat computation.

Concat operators include ConcatD and ConcatV2D, and Conv2D operators include Conv2D and Conv2D_Compress.

The following models do not support StridedWrite, but the hardware can emulate equivalent StridedWrite behavior. ConvConcatFusionPass will still match these models.<br>

## Constraints

- For quantization, the fusion pattern must be enabled. Otherwise, the output dtype of TransData is invalid.
- Dynamic shapes are not supported.
- This pass applies when all Concat inputs except the final one satisfy C axis alignment.
- Fusion of Quant and Mish operators is allowed when the Concat inputs have their C axis aligned with the data type. That is, the fusion takes effect when the Concat inputs meet any of the following conditions:
    - If the original dtype is fp16 or float, the value of dim C must be a multiple of 16.
    - If the original dtype is int8, the value of dim C must be a multiple of 32.
    - If the original dtype is int4, the value of dim C must be a multiple of 64.

- If the concat input branch contains the Pooling and mish operators, the quant and mish operators are not fused.
- For details about the conditions for Requant to take effect, see [V100RequantFusionPass](V100RequantFusionPass.md) or [V200RequantFusionPass](V200RequantFusionPass.md).
