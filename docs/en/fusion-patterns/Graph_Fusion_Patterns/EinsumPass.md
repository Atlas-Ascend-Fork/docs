## Description

Constructs a computational graph based on the expression of the Einsum operator. As shown in the following figure, the dotted-line nodes in the computational graph indicate that operators may be added based on the actual expression.

- For **static shapes**, there are two cases:

  Static shape and single input:

  After:

  Static shape and dual inputs (Depending on the specific expression, the two inputs of the MatMul operator may be swapped):

  After:

- For **dynamic shapes**, the graph to which the Einsum operator belongs before fusion has dual inputs, as shown in the following figure:

  ![](../figures/EinsumPass_5.png)

  Currently, 14 types of expressions are supported for dynamic shapes. The following figures show the graphs after fusion.

 1. The Einsum expression is in the form of "abc,cde->abde":

            ![](../figures/EinsumPass_57.png)

            Unsqueeze, ReduceSum, Unsqueeze/FlattenV2, Reshape, Transpose, and Squeeze are optional, and ReduceSum and Unsqueeze/FlattenV2 may appear multiple times.

## Constraints

- This fusion pattern is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.
- The Einsum operator can have only one or two inputs, and the number of elements of the input tensor cannot overflow the int64 representation range.
- For static shapes, the Einsum expression supports only a single input with a single output or dual inputs with a single output.
- For static shapes, the input or output expression cannot have duplicate dimension labels.
- For static shapes, if the fused operator is BatchMatMul, the data type of the input tensor can only be float16 or float32.
- For dynamic shapes, only 14 Einsum expressions are supported (the specific dimension label is only an example): "abc,cde->abde", "abcd,aecd->aceb", "abcd,adbe->acbe", "abcd,cde->abe", "abc,cd->abd", "abc,dc->abd", "abc,abd->dc", "abc,dec->abde", "abc,abde->dec", "abcd,aecd->acbe", "abcd,acbe->aecd", "abcd,ecd->abe", "abcd,abe->ecd", and "abcd,acbe->adbe". If the Einsum operator has only one input, the input cannot have a dynamic shape.
- For dynamic shapes, the number of input dimensions must be the same as that in the corresponding Einsum input expression.
- For dynamic shapes, the Einsum expression supports a single input with a single output, dual inputs with a single output, or empty output. The input or output expression cannot have duplicate dimension labels. A dimension label of the output must exist in the input.
- For dynamic shapes, only input tensors with a maximum of four dimensions are supported.
