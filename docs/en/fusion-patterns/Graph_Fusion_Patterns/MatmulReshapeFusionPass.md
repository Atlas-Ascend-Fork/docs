## Constraints

- This pattern is disabled by default. You can enable it by referring to [How to Disable or Enable a Fusion Pattern](../Introduction.md).
- Only static shapes are supported.
- Supported data types: BFLOAT16, FLOAT16, and FLOAT32.
- The input of x1 is [M, K]. The input of x2 is not transposed, and since `N=1` is on the last axis, the x2 input is [K, 1].
- The fusion pattern takes effect when the data type is BFLOAT16 or FLOAT16, and K is less than 27392.
- This fusion pattern does not take effect when the data type is BFLOAT16 or FLOAT16, 8 ≤ K ≤ 64, and M ≥ 8192.
- This fusion pattern does not take effect when the data type is BFLOAT16 or FLOAT16, K is greater than 12800, and M is greater than 16384.
- The fusion pattern does not take effect when the data type is FLOAT32, 8 ≤ K ≤ 64, and 8192 ≤ M ≤ 32768.
- This fusion pattern does not take effect when the data type is FLOAT32, M = 9, or K = 23697 or 27167.
