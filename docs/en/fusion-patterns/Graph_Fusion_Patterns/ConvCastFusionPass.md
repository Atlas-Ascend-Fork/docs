## Constraints

- This fusion takes effect when the input data type of Conv2D is float16 and the output data type of Cast is float32.
- When the Conv2D or Cast node is dynamic, fusion is not performed.
- When the Conv2D input node has StridedRead, fusion is not performed.
- When the number of Conv2D output nodes is greater than 1, fusion is not performed.
